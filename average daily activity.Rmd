first i calculate the mean of all days and then i make the plot
```{r}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
activity_steps_mean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(activity_steps_mean$interval, activity_steps_mean$steps, type = "l", col = "tan3", xlab = "Intervals", ylab = "Total steps per interval", main = "Number of steps per interval (averaged) (NA removed)")
```
then to find the maximum steps
```{r}
max_steps <-max(activity_steps_mean$steps)
max_interval <- activity_steps_mean$interval[which(activity_steps_mean$steps == max_steps)]
max_steps <- round(max_steps, digits = 2)
print(max_steps)
print(max_interval)
```
