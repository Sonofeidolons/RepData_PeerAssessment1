i have unziped the files,then read them and then took the number of steps taken per day
```{r}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
activity_steps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
print(activity_steps_day)
``` 
then i take the histogram
```{r}
hist(activity_steps_day$steps, xlab = "Steps per Day", main = "Total number of steps taken per day", col = "red")
```
then i calculate the mean and median
```{r}
mean_steps <- mean(activity_steps_day$steps)
median_steps <- median(activity_steps_day$steps)
print(mean_steps)
print(median_steps)
```
